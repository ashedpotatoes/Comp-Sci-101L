## ERROR HANDLING:
#I put the program inside the conditional statement to check if the number is less than 3 and greater than 0 to ensure the program wouldn’t run if there was invalid input
        # I used in range(1, 101) in order to get 100 in the range
      # I used lower and uppercase n because the program said ‘N to exit’ but the examples used lowercase 
#‘n’—so I checked for both
